    "Hereâ€™s an explanation with examples for each:\n",
    "\n",
    "for Loop Use Case: Iterating Over a Sequence\n",
    "A for loop is typically used when you know in advance how many times you want to iterate or when you are iterating over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, string, or range).\n",

    "Example: Suppose you want to print each item in a list:\n",

    "Explanation: You use a for loop here because you want to iterate over each element in the list fruits.\n",

    "while Loop Use Case: Looping Until a Condition is Met\n",
    "A while loop is used when you want to continue looping as long as a certain condition is true. It is generally used when you do not know in advance how many times you need to iterate.\n",

    "Example: Suppose you want to keep asking the user for a password until they enter the correct one:\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
